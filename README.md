# Dockerfiles

This project is mainly for my benefit. I use these containers on my local
machine rather than littering my laptop with every dependency under the sun for
every new project.

I typically add a bash alias to [`adlawson/dotfiles`](https://github.com/adlawson/dotfiles)
to make running them easy. Almost as if I had littered my machine with every
tool I need.
